Topic Modeling
==============
A little app for a little bit of court case topic modeling.

Create a `keys.coffee` file in root directory
Copy over content from `keys.example.coffee`

Then run commands:
```
npm install
npm start

```
In a different tab, run grunt:

```
grunt
```

This site is still work in progress.

The work lives here for now: https://cap-lil.herokuapp.com/
